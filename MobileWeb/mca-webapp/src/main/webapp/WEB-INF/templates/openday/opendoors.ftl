    <h2>How to get the most out of an open day</h2>

    <p>As soon as you’ve decided what you want to study, you're faced with the question of which
       university you want to go to. Choosing the right place to spend at least the next three
       years of your life is not easy but visiting different universities can help you reach a
       more informed decision. Open days offer the perfect opportunity to find out all the extra
       things you have been wondering about. You are likely to be offered the chance to speak to
       existing students about their experiences at university and members of staff will be on
       hand to answer your questions about the course. Most importantly, you will be able to get
       a 'feel' for the uni that you're visiting, which will help you decide whether or not it is
       somewhere you can see yourself ‘belonging' in a year's time.</p>

    <h3>What to do before you go...</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Find out when the open days are. Visit uni websites, check prospectuses for dates or 
            visit <a href="http://www.opendays.com">www.opendays.com</a>. It's not the end of the
            world if you can't make official open days, you could visit on your own informally,
            but access to departments, students and staff will be more limited.</li>
        <li>Ensure the University you want to go to offers the course you want. Find out which
            site or campus it is taught at, as some universities have smaller campuses for
            particular courses out of town.</li>
        <li>Do your research! Read as much information as you can. Trying to form a picture of
            a university in a day is difficult but will be much easier if you know some things
            already. Get on the internet. Visit university websites and order prospectuses.
            Find out if the course appeals to you. What sort of things will you be studying?
            What are the entry requirements? Then you can save your more in-depth questions for
            the academics on the open day.</li>
        <li>Check out the booking requirements. Some universities need you to book onto the open
            day in advance but for others you can just turn up.</li>
        <li>Get a copy of the open day's programme to help you plan the day. It may be available
            online or could be sent to you once you've registered.</li>
        <li>How are you getting to the open day? If you are visiting a city university, it is
            probably best to travel by train to avoid problems parking. However you travel, make
            sure you leave plenty of time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What to do on the day...</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Think about the journey from home. Is the university that you're visiting too close to
            where you live, or too far away?</li>
        <li>Think finances. The cost of living will vary depending on where you are studying. Some
            towns may be cheaper than others. Try to find out how much you will be paying for
            accommodation. Research what university bursaries, scholarships and Disabled Students'
            Allowance (DSA) and child support grants are available, and whether you are eligible
            for financial help.</li>
        <li>Ask the academics what they are looking for in a personal statement. Are there any
            work experience requirements? Are there any additional tests you need to take?</li>
        <li>Have a think about potential living arrangements. Would you like to be cooked for in a
            catered hall or would you prefer a self-catered flat? Are you happy to share a bathroom
            with other people or is an ‘ensuite' top of your priority list? How do you feel about
            sharing a room? Or is distance your biggest concern and you'd do anything to avoid a
            45 minute uphill walk to uni on a wet Monday morning? It's common for universities to
            give tours around some of their accommodation at open days and it's a really good idea
            to take a look.</li>
        <li>Is the uni city- or campus-based? Campus universities are confined to one area, where
            students live among students, whereas a city university co-exists with a much larger
            and more diverse community.</li>
        <li>Can you see yourself here? Do you love the peace and quiet of the countryside and would
            find the bright lights of London town too overwhelming? Or are you a fan of the fast
            paced, 24-hour city lifestyle, who could be left disappointed by a small town with
            just one nightclub?</li>
        <li>What sort of social activities are on offer? What's its music and theatre scene like
            and is there a venue that hosts your sort of gig or club night? What are the shops
            like?</li>
        <li>What types of university clubs and societies are on offer? Is one uni more
            appealing than another because it has a good student newspaper or chocolate
            appreciation society?</li>
        <li>If you're a sports fan, see if you can have a look at the sports facilities. Find out
            if there are any local sports teams that you could get involved in and whether there
            are any notable sports events hosted locally.</li>
        <li>Investigate other university facilities. You could find out about computers, libraries
            and laboratories, support available for D/deaf and disabled students, destinations
            of recent graduates and opportunities for part-time work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Top tips...</h3>

    <p>The best way to answer the above questions is to ask, ask and ask. Make the most of being
        in and around the university you're visiting. Speak to the students and lecturers – they'll
        be delighted to explain things to you and give you their point of view.</p>

    <p>Decide if you want to visit the open day on your own. Is it possible for a parent or carer
       to go along with you, or do you worry that your Dad will cramp your style? Is there anyone
        at your school or college that is interested in checking out the same uni?</p>

    <p>Don't worry about where your friends are going. You are guaranteed to make new friends
    at uni so don't sacrifice your decision to go where your girlfriend, boyfriend or friends are
    going.</p>

    <p>If your visit to an open day involves an overnight stay, use it wisely. Go and check out the
        local sights, do some window shopping and maybe check out some of the renowned student
        haunts. It's all about whether you can picture yourself there in a year or so's time.</p>
