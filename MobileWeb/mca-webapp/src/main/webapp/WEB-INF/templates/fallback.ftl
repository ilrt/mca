<p>Unable to find a FreeMarker template for the resource &lt;${resource}&gt;</p>
<p>This usually means that the property &lt;http://vocab.bris.ac.uk/mca/registry#template&gt;
   has not been set in the registry for general navigation items. Also, it might
   need to be set in SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries (or code) for other use cases.</p>
