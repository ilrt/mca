MOBILE CAMPUS ASSISTANT - README
================================

INTRODUCTION
------------

"Mobile Campus Assistant" is software that was developed during a 
JISC funded rapid innovation project of the same name. The software
has continued to be developed through the JISC funded  MyMobileBristol
(http://mymobilebristol.com) and Greening Events 2 
(http://greeningevents.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/) projects. The work was undertaken
by the R&D/ILRT team of IT Services,  University of Bristol.

COMPILING
---------

This is a Java project that uses maven as the build tool. The project 
is modular and organised into a number of modules. To compile and 
install the modules:

cd MobileWeb/
mvn install

RUNNING
-------

You need to deploy the War file to a servlet container that
implements the 2.5 servlet specification.

For development purposes it is possible to configure the project
to use an IDE managed servlet container - the developers of the
project used Eclipse, Netbeans and IntelliJ IDEA.

The source code is only configured to use a couple of
public data sources provided by the University of Bristol. For
a more comprehensive example of what is possible, please view
the demonstrator: <http://mca.ilrt.bristol.ac.uk>

The demonstrator uses licensed images that could not be
distributed with the source code.

To run the application via maven you can run:

cd mca-webapp/
mvn jetty:run

The website will be available at <http://localhost:8080/>.
